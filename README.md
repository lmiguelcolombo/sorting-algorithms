# Sorting Algorithms

## Purpose

This repository aims to help me on the path of understanding and applying different sorting algorithms. Plus, I want to help **you** understand this too!

## Hey, what's an algorithm?

An algorithm is nothing more than a **process** with a set of **instructions** to **solve a problem**.

## Therefore...

Sorting algorithms are meant to **sort** unsorted groups of elements. Okay, do you think it's dumb explanation? Well, it's not. It's just that it's a **very simple concept**!

In our real world, it is a process like _organizing/arranging your wardrobe_.

## Different sorting algorithms

There are different sorting algorithms:

1. Selection sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Insertion sort
4. Merge sort
5. Quick sort
6. Heap sort
7. Counting sort
8. Radix sort
9. Bucket sort
